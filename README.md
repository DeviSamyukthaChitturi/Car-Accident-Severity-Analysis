# Car Accident Severity Analysis

Welcome to the Car Accident Severity Analysis in United Kingdom (UK) dataset repository! 
#### Overview
This repository contains data and scripts for analyzing car accident severity in the UK using DfT's Road Accidents Safety Data, aiming to uncover insights on geographic, demographic, and vehicular factors influencing accident severity.
#### Purpose
This repository aims to analyze car accident severity in the UK using data from the Department for Transport, providing insights into road safety trends and effectiveness of campaigns.
#### Goal
The analysis aims to answer various questions related to car accident severity, including:

1. Comparison of different areas based on accident severity combined with population data.
2. Trends in accidents involving different road users such as motorcyclists, pedestrians, and cyclists.
3. Effectiveness of road safety campaigns.
4. Likelihood of accidents for different demographic groups and types of vehicles.
#### Potential Aplications
Predictive modeling for real-time accident severity assessment to enhance emergency response and traffic management systems.
Utilizing demographic and vehicle data to tailor targeted road safety interventions and reduce accident rates.
